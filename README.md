# Project Objectives

In this project, I will examine how Western music was introduced during Korea’s colonization roughly between 1900-1945 in early modern Korea by using Timeline JS. Around the same time in the 19th century numerous imperial attempts to open national borders of Joseon, a Korea dynastic kingdom at that era, and Western missionaries’ attempts to educate Koreans had begun. As Japan had accepted Western superiority discourse; Korea, a colony of Japan, naturally followed the colonial discourse that legitimizes Western hegemony. Not only were technological/industrial products manufactured, such as cannons and railroads, which signified modernity, but also music as an auditory medium sparked a modern shift in people’s lives. These mediums included gramophones/phonographs, radios and orchestras and were introduced as new symbols of a ‘new’ modern culture. Eventually Western music contributed to setting up a binary between Western culture and traditional culture; subject and other, advanced and underdeveloped, civilized and barbaric cultures. By visualizing timelines with the help of Timeline JS, I’m hoping to see the process of how Western music introduced in early modern Korea.

# 조선 상황

쇄국정책을 펼치던 18세기 중후반을 지나20세기를 맞이하며 조선은 inter strife와 Western의 압박을 못이겨 점차 나라 문을 열게 되었다. 많은 정치가들과 학자들이 외국의 선진문명을 배우겠다며 외국에 다녀오고, 그 문물을 받아들이자 주장을 하게 된다. 특히 김관, 홍난파와 같은 배운 음악인들은 음악을 통한 계몽을 주장하였는데 여기서 음악이란 조선 전통음악이 아닌 서구음악을 뜻했다. 홍난파는 Nan Pa Hong (1897-1941), a Korean composer, music critic, and educator, dedicated his life in enlightening Koreans by music. He published the first Korean music magazine titled “Samgwang” (삼광), which means three light. In the introduction, Hong argued that traditional culture is inferior while Western culture is superior; adopting Western culture is the most important work for developing the nation. He noted as, “we are trying to cultivate our power and bring Western ‘new’ culture, and power from music is truly needed……how their (Western) culture transcends us, their thoughts are sophisticated, and their ambitious is great…” As he was a dominant composer in Korea, his power in the society was acknowledgeable. His desire to adopt Western music triggered Korean society to actively accept Western hegemony. Kim Kwan(1910~1946) was a music critic who studied in Japan. He created a musical journal named 'Music Critic", and had a huge power in the society. In 1933, he claimed that Korea should learn how to play Western music with .more systemetically. As he noted, "currently, Korean orchestras are not performing Western music well for 50 years since Western music was introduced in Korea. In other words, we are still in incomplete...", Western music should be well-understood in order to improve Korean music. 이렇듯 학자들은 서구의 음악을 칭송하는 한편 한국 전통음악의 열등함을 강조하며 Western music을 어서 accept해야 함을 주장하였다.

# Orchestra

Eckert was a German musician who studied military music. He composed Japanese national anthem in 1880 when he served as director of Japanese Navy Band. He contributed in introducing Western music to Japan by publishing song books used in Japan, establishing the military band, and composing Western music. As Gojong admired to adopt both Western and Japanese system, he invited Eckert to compose Korean national anthem. He also served as a director of military band, organizing military band and purchasing Western instruments. In 1907, military band was dissolved in accordance with the  demise of the empire. He decided to remain in Korea and establish the music school, dedicating himself in education.

# Missionaries

Modern Western-style schools were established by missionaries in 1885. (Baejae Academy and Ewha School)
Students were taught in English even though they did not understand it. Textbooks were drawn from the Bible, and English hymns. Protestant hymns played a significant role in introducing Western music in the 19th century to 20th century in Joseon.
